# 📊 WhatsApp Chat Analyzer

A powerful tool to analyze your **WhatsApp chat exports** and get detailed insights into your messaging behavior — with charts, word clouds, and activity summaries.

## 🚀 Overview
WhatsApp does not provide detailed analytics about your chats.  
This project helps you **analyze your exported WhatsApp chat files** (individual or group) and visualize interesting statistics such as message frequency, word count, emoji usage, and more.
